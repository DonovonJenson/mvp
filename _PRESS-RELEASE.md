There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows. 

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

  Freestyle Rap Rhyme Helper Tool 

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

A tool which generates rhymes, allowing new rappers to learn freestyling more quickly. 

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

  The freestyle rap rhyme helper tool takes an old technique - serving words - and adds to that additional rhymes. This will allow new rappers to learn how to freestyle while also adding to their rhyme base. It also gives beginners an approachable way into freestyling, as the pressure of rhyming is relieved.  

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.

  New rappers often don't know where to begin for freestyling. They get hung up on the rhyme aspects and are incapable of working on anything else for a long time.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

  This tool will serve up both words and rhymes, freeing up beginners to think about other aspects, such as deivery and flow. 

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.

  "This is the tool I wanted when I was learning to freestyle. It allows a beginner to practice multiple skills and feel good in the process. It's going to change the way rappers learn to freestlye."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.

  As soon as the page loads, words and rhymes will start being served to you. As soon as you're ready, jump in and start using them to freestyle! 

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.

  "I never thought I'd be able to freestyle. I could never think of rhymes! Now, I have a tool which allows me to skip that step. Also, I'm rhyming better in my freestyles even without it. It's amazing!"

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.

  The freestyle rap rhyme tool is excellent for beginners and others alike. If you've ever wanted to improve your freestyle rap skills, try it out. There's no doubt you'll make massive gains in just a few short sessions.
